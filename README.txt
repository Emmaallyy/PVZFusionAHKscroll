Hey! I'm new to making scripts in autohotkey but I figured I'd share this so that others who are playing pvz fusion can also use a scroll wheel even if it is rather janky at times :p

IMPORTANT:
My monitor is 2560x1600, I used ratios of the size of the window so it should work on most resolutions, but the slots change positions slightly when going up and down resolutions. I changed my monitor's resolution to 1920x1080 and it still worked, but please tell me if it doesn't work for you!
