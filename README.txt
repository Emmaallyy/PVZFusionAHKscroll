Hey! I'm new to making scripts in autohotkey but I figured I'd share this so that others who are playing pvz fusion can also use a scroll wheel even if it is rather janky at times :p

IMPORTANT:
My monitor is 2560x1600 and I used absolute position for the mouse movement, so if you are using a different resolution I would assume you need to change the coordinates, in that case just use AutoHotkey window spy to get the x coordinates and replace them to fit your resolution
